# Maynooth CS210

A repository for Maynooths CS210 year

This was created with the intention of learning and improving from each others code, if you plan on just copying code then good luck with the exam worth 90% of the grade.

A folder will exist for each lab and if you are submitting your code it should be titled as your username, for example "myUsername". 
This is just for the convenience of finding files and making sure they don't all have the same name.

Thank you :)



<sup> ps if the college has a problem with this contatct me and i'll take it down </sup>
